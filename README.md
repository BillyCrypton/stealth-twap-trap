# Stealth TWAP Trap on Drosera (Hoodi Testnet)

This repository contains smart contracts, scripts, and configuration for deploying a **Stealth Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Trap** on the **Drosera network**, powered by **Hoodi Ethereum testnet**.  

The setup includes:
- `StealthTWAPTrap.sol` â†’ Core trap contract
- `StealthTWAPResponse.sol` â†’ Response handler contract (emits events when trap triggers)
- Deployment + testing scripts
- TOML configs for Drosera trap execution

Workflow Example

Block Sampling

Trap collects price data over sample_window_blocks (e.g., 20 blocks).

TWAP Calculation

Trap computes the time-weighted average price.

Threshold Check

If the TWAP exceeds the set threshold, the trap conditions are met.

Drosera Trigger

Drosera operator detects the breach and calls the trapâ€™s configured respond function.

Response Execution

Drosera routes the call to StealthTWAPResponse.handleTWAPEvent(address,uint256).

Event Emission

The response contract emits TWAPTriggered(token, twapValue, triggeredBy).

Off-chain Monitoring

Whitelisted operator (your address) listens to the emitted event logs.

This proves trap execution and can trigger further automation.
